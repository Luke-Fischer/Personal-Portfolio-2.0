          I'm a software engineer who works across the full stack to build real-world software that delivers value. Outside of work, Iâ€™m always looking for the next side project or open source contribution that challenges me, sharpens my skills, and creates meaningful user experiences. I continue to grow as a developer by earning certifications and exploring new technologies that push my technical depth.
